## General European Resume Guidelines

### 1\. Format:

* European resumes often follow the Europass CV format, a standardized format used widely across the EU. However, tailoring resumes to local preferences is key.  
* Use reverse-chronological order to list professional experience and education.  
* Keep the document 1-2 pages long, depending on experience.

### 2\. Personal Information:

* Include: Full Name, Address, Phone Number, and Professional Email.  
* Optional: Nationality, Date of Birth, and Photo (common in Germany and Sweden; less common in England, Wales, and Scotland).  
* Avoid overly personal details like marital status or gender unless specified in the job description.

### 3\. Professional Summary:

* Start with a concise professional summary or objective statement, highlighting career achievements and goals.

### 4\. Key Skills:

* Include a skills section emphasizing technical, linguistic, and interpersonal skills.  
* Languages: Clearly state proficiency (e.g., fluent, advanced, intermediate) and refer to the CEFR framework (e.g., B2, C1).

### 5\. Professional Experience:

* Emphasize achievements using metrics and action verbs.  
* Tailor responsibilities to the job description.

### 6\. Education:

* List degrees, institutions, locations, and dates.  
* Highlight relevant coursework for entry-level candidates.

### 7\. Additional Sections:

* Certifications: List professional certifications.  
* Languages: Highlight multilingual proficiency.  
* Hobbies/Interests: Include only if relevant to the job or company culture.
